write receptive field of each layer as a comment
write the input channel dimensions
run each cell one by one
add a new cell at the end of the file, explaining what (according to you) all is wrong with the network?
Once the model is trained for 10 epochs, mode the file to your Session 2 repository on your GitHub
Upload the Github link the submission section (do not forget to add theschoolofai as a collaborator)
