# Write your Assignment 3 again such that:
### 1. Finally after 4 code iterations achieve 99.4% accuracy.
### 2. Less than 15k Parameters.
### 3. Have started from a Vanilla network (no BN, DropOut, LR, larger batch size, change in Optimizer, etc).
### 4. Make sure you are tracking your code's performance, and writing down your observations are you achieve better or worse results
### 5. Your second code can only have max 3 improvements over first one, third can have only max 3 over second and so on. 
### 6. All of your iterations are in different files and named properly like First, Second, etc.
### 7. All of you iterations are in a single folder
### 8. All of your iterations have a Header note, describing what all you are planning to do in this code
### 19. All of your code is very well documented
### 20. There is a readme file describing the above mentioned (at least 24) points. The title of this file is Architectural Basics. You need to put them in order in which you will think about them or execute them in your experiments thought behind that order
