Instructions:

Stick to 3x3 kernels only

Do this on Colab, but once done upload to your GitHub Project 1.


### Assignment 1B

What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?

Why should we only (well mostly) use 3x3 Kernels?

How many times do we need to perform 3x3 convolution operation to reach 1x1 from 199x199 (show calculations)
